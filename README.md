# mercadito
A front-end demo with MercadoLibre's UI, Chico.
Watch it in action [here](http://joelalejandro.github.io/mercadito/).

## how to run
This project requires `npm`, `bower`, and `gulp-cli`.

If you don't have `gulp` installed already, simply do `npm install -g gulp-cli`.

Then, run the following commands:

- `npm install && bower install`
- `gulp serve` (or simply `gulp`)

### clean up
If needed, you can run a single `clean` task from `gulp`:

`gulp clean`

This will destroy `dist/` and all of its contents.
